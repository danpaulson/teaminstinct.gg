  <li>Competitiveness and innovation trumps the “Whale factor” <i>to an extent...</i></li>
  <li>Members are expected to remain in the top 25 in PvP (Daily Average).</li>
  <li>Members are expected to complete their 600 daily. Any foreseen issues must be reported in advance.</li>
  <li>Members are expected to maintain active involvement in Wars, TB’s, Slack communications, and a minimum of posting 0 in raids.</li>
  <li>The Voting Leadership has autonomy to make decisions for the guild as long as they are unanimous after responsible debate. Unanimous decisions will be announced in full before the wheels of change have been set in motion and members given at least 24 hours to discuss the change before it is implemented.</li>
  <li>Trust being an important aspect of a close-knit group, we do not want "proprietary" information, such as theory crafting, team structures or raid strategies, being released to the public without prior approval from the team.</li>
  <li>During time of New Content, expect temporary and/or permanent squad changes, as Team Instinct prepares the best squad of 50 for conquering a World First.</li>
  <li>Current Goals: Maintain a squad that represents the strongest Guild in the game on GP leaderboard; Always play to win in Territory War; Achieve World First Content (content that is designed for Guild Achievements).</li>
