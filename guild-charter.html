<h3 class="card-title ti-block">Guild Charter</h3>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Guild Managment consists of all Officers contributing as advisors, with 6 majority-voted on members (2 from each squad) that vote unanimous for guild changes and direction.</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Competitiveness and innovation trumps the “Whale factor”</li>
  <li>Members are expected to remain in the top 10 in PvP (Daily Average)</li>
  <li>Members are expected to complete their 600 daily with the current time frames and penalty structure remaining in place</li>
  <li>Members should make an active effort to contribute in the various chat rooms to lend their experience toward theory crafting and debates to promote innovation and keeping the guild on top. We also want everyone participating in exploring new content and pushing the guild forward.</li>
  <li>The Leadership council has autonomy to make decisions for the guild as long as they are unanimous. Unanimous decisions will be announced in full before the wheels of change have been set in motion and members given at least 24 hours to discuss the change before it is implemented. Decisions that are not unanimous within the council will be put to a full guild vote requiring a minimum of both 24 hours and 50% of members to cast a vote</li>
  <li>Trust being an important aspect of a close nit group, we do not want "proprietary" information, such as theory crafting, team structures or raid strategies, being released to the public without prior approval from the team. We believe a more close knit guild and more transparent leadership will facilitate this occurring without unnecessary delay</li>
  <li>Work to make your GW team the biggest pain in the ass possible so that people dread seeing TI in GW</li>
  <li>Any member of the council wishing to make arrangements outside of the guild on matters relevant to and effecting the guild (alliance/ agreements/recruiting etc...) must obtain prior approval from the council</li>
  <li>Each division of the guild (Bravo, Delta, Echo) will be responsible for electing and maintaining leadership structure for the purposes of coordinating raids and sending division announcements</li>
</ol>
